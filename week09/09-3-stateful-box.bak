;; version 3: well, that didn't work.  In this version, we'll make the
;; box stateful.  To keep track of this we'll add a new interface:
;; StatefulObj<%>. 

;; We use Void in the contracts to document this.
;; Void methods work by EFFECT.  They can return anything.
;; the contract Void means that whoever called the method promises to
;; ignore the value.

;; We'll expand the container to contain both ordinary (functional)
;; objects and stateful ones.

;; Then we'll redo Box% to be a StatefulObj<%>.

;; version 2: add a bouncing ball to the container.  The ball will
;; bounce inside a box.

;; version 1: basic architecture for worlds with multiple objects in them.

;; start this with (run).
